# ðŸ§  Smart Health Predictor â€“ Diabetes Risk Detection

This project is a machine learning-driven application that predicts whether an individual is at risk of diabetes based on clinical health metrics. It features robust data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and model development, with plans for an interactive web-based dashboard.

## ðŸš€ Features

- âœ… Predicts diabetes based on patient metrics (Glucose, BMI, Insulin, etc.)
- âœ… Choose between 3 ML models (RF, XGBoost, Logistic Regression)
- âœ… Model performance table with Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1 Score, ROC AUC
- âœ… SHAP explainability:
  - ðŸ“‰ Individual waterfall plot (local)
  - ðŸ“Š Global beeswarm summary (optional)
- âœ… Clean 2-column UI layout using Streamlit
- âœ… Scalable structure with saved models and input scaler
- âœ… Ready for expansion (multi-disease support)
