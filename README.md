# ðŸ§  Smart Health Predictor â€“ Diabetes Risk Detection

This project is a machine learning-driven application that predicts whether an individual is at risk of diabetes based on clinical health metrics. It features robust data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and model development, with plans for an interactive web-based dashboard.

## ðŸš€ Features
- Predicts diabetes using inputs like Glucose, BMI, Insulin, etc.
- Cleaned and preprocessed real-world medical dataset
- EDA with KDE plots, heatmaps, and distribution analysis
- Scaled features and stratified train/test split
- Ready for dashboard and multi-disease expansion (heart, liver)
